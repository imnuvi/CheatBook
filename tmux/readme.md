Tmux is one of those things I've always known about, but to understand how useful it is, you have to start using it.

Here are things I learnt and use constantly in tmux.


## Configuration
The tmux.conf file is usually under ~/.tmux.conf

```
# Change prefix from 'Ctrl+B' to 'Ctrl+S'
unbind C-b
set-option -g prefix C-s
bind-key C-s send-prefix

# Enable mouse mode
set -g mouse on

# set vim like movement
setw -g mode-keys vi

# leader + r reloads tmux config
unbind r
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf
```


## Keybindings

setw -g mode-keys vi
