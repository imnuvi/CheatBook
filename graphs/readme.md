## Intro

Graphs are essential structures for representing and describing natural processes and to explain complex networks. 
Although I have been very interested in graphs, I have never invested much in them other than learning about some algorithms involving them.

Now I will take a deep dive into how each aspect connects and various interesting algorithms that involve graphs.



### Ball Tree nearest neighbour algorithm

### Kosaraju's algorithm
