- Transcription Factors : Proteins that control gene expression by binding to specific sites on the DNA and control the rate at which the DNA is transcribed.
- Consensus Site : Places where Transcription factors bind to on the DNA
- Transcripton Factor Perturbation : Modifying the action of a transcription factor and measuring the deviation in gene expression.
- Gene regulatory network : Collection of transcription factors that control gene expression levels in a cell.
    - These networks allow the organism to respond to changes in the environment.
