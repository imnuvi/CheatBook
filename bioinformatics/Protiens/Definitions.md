### These are all the common definitions for Proteins and tools used in protein structure analysis


Protein docking - Protein docking is a computational method for predicting the structure of the protein complex. These are useful for predicting proteins that haven't been determined yet


Molecular Mechanics - This is an empirical method of calculation of properties such as molecular geometry, heat of formation, strain energy, dipole moment and vibrational frequencies



What is addition of FAD in proteins : The addition of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) to proteins can involve covalent or non-covalent bonding, and can be aided by protein assembly factors


FFTdock - tool that used Fast Fourier Transform to predict where each protein part can get connected - https://academiccharmm.org/documentation/version/c47b1/fftdock


predicted local distance difference test - (pLDDT)
