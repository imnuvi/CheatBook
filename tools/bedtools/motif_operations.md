On the Genome there are certain regions called cis-regulatory elements. These are elements that regulate the expression of a gene not by themselves, but with the help of other elements. cis - means the same element regulating itself. 
Regulation is controlled by certain regions called promoter regions. These are regions on the genome, about 1000 basepairs upstream ( on the 5' end ). This region has the TSS or Transcription Start Site where polymerase binds to and starts transcription of a gene. There are regions in the promoter where certain proteins called Transcription Factors bind to. These usually have a similar pattern and are called motifs. These motifs are present all over the promoter region. 

We will need to identify this region in order for us to understand which proteins regulate and bind to which promoter region and to identify if a region we have is a potential binding site for a protein.
