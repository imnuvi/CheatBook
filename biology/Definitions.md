## Biological terms


Cell Markers - These are molecules or substances that can be used to uniquely identify different types of cells. 
                They can be unique set of proteins or carbohydrates attached to the cell or they can be intracellular.
                

Transcript Localization - This is the process by which cells get polarized. This is the process by which RNA gets accumulated at one part of the cell. This happens in almost all types of cells

Marker genes - This has different meanings in different contexts.
            1) This can be a gene that is highly expressed in one type of cell
            2) This can be also mean a DNA sequence that is introduced in an organism to create a distinct phenotype or genotype that can be monitored and observed.
            3) This can also point to Orthologous genes which can be used to differentiate species


Orthologous genes - These are genes that originated from a common ancestor but splitted out due to speciation.


CTS Cell Type Specific Genes - These are genes that are highly expressed in one cell type, but lowly expressed in others.
            
Gene Product - A gene product is a biochemical product of expression of a gene either rna or a protein. 
                A measurement of the amount of gene product is sometimes used to infer how active ( expressive ) a gene is.


Goblet Cells - Goblet cell markers are glandular epithelial cells that secrete mucus in the intestine and lungs.
Epithelial cells - These are cells that cover most surfaces of multicellular organisms

Microenvironment - It is a small and specialized biophysical environment that surrounds and supports cell tissues.




## Stat terms

Co-expression of genes - These are genes that have a similar expression pattern across multiple conditions.
Gene Co-expression analysis - This is a statistical method used to find out genes with similar expression pattern across different environments

Gene Co-expression network GCN - This is an undirected graph, where each node corresponds to a gene and a pair of nodes are connected with an edge if there is a significant co-expression relationship between them.
